## Work Experience

**Data Analyst @ Grof (_March 2024 - Dec 2024_)**
*Identified and resolved issue in ETL pipelines
- Improving data accuracy for over 50% of revenue-related metrics, ensuring reliable insights for decision-making.
*Optimized SQL queries for MRR analysis,
- Incorporating add-ons, one-time charges, and first-time fee, resulting in a 20% reduction in report generation time and enhanced accuracy of recurring revenue forecasts.
*Developed advanced churn and growth rate models
- Accounting for complex scenarios like paused, canceled, and resumed subscriptions, which improved subscription mrr amount accuracy to 100% and supported strategic retention initiatives.
* Automated the generation of KPI reports
- Integrating data from multiple platforms using SQL queries and Python ETL scripts. Consolidated data into a unified dashboard, eliminating the need for manual extraction from disparate platforms and reducing report preparation time by 80%. This enabled management to access up-to-date KPIs in real-time, supporting faster and more informed decision-making.

## Projects
### Data-Driven EEG Band Discovery with Decision Trees
[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/8/3048)

Developed objective strategy for discovering optimal EEG bands based on signal power spectra using **Python**. This data-driven approach led to better characterization of the underlying power spectrum by identifying bands that outperformed the more commonly used band boundaries by a factor of two. The proposed method provides a fully automated and flexible approach to capturing key signal components and possibly discovering new indices of brain activity.

### Decoding Physical and Cognitive Impacts of Particulate Matter Concentrations at Ultra-Fine Scales
[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/11/4240)

Used **Matlab** to train over 100 machine learning models which estimated particulate matter concentrations based on a suite of over 300 biometric variables. We found biometric variables can be used to accurately estimate particulate matter concentrations at ultra-fine spatial scales with high fidelity (r2 = 0.91) and that smaller particles are better estimated than larger ones. Inferring environmental conditions solely from biometric measurements allows us to disentangle key interactions between the environment and the body.
